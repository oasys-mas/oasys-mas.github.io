    <!-- About the Tutorial -->
    <section id="description">
      <h2>About the Tutorial</h2>
      <p>Many real-world applications of multiagent systems (MAS) are open agent systems (OASYS) where the sets of agents, tasks, and capabilities can dynamically change over time. Often, these changes are unpredictable and unknown in advance by the decision making agents utilizing their capabilities to accomplish tasks. In contrast, most methods for autonomous decision making (whether planning, reinforcement learning, or game theory) assume that the set of agents, tasks, and capabilities are static throughout the lifetime of the system. Mismatches between the assumptions of the agentsâ€™ reasoning and models of the environment vs. the underlying dynamics of the environment can risk critical failure of agents deployed to real-world applications. In this tutorial, we will (1) introduce OASYS as a challenging complexity of decision making in multiagent systems, illustrating different sources of openness in several real-world applications of MAS, (2) summarize state-of-the-art solutions for decision making in OASYS within both the multiagent planning and multiagent reinforcement learning paradigms, and (3) highlight several promising avenues of future research that would enhance the ability of agents to reason within OASYS.</p>

      <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
      <p>Participants will enhance their understanding of (1) the challenges of multiagent decision-making in open agent systems caused by the sets of agents, tasks, and/or agent capabilities changing over time in dynamic and unpredictable ways, (2) state-of-the-art planning and reinforcement learning solutions for autonomous reasoning in open agent systems, including a comparison of their relative strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios, and (3) active areas of current and future research for improving reasoning in such challenging multiagent environments.</p>

    <!-- Target Audience -->
    <section id="audience">
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>We expect two target audiences for this tutorial. First, researchers studying multiagent decision making (e.g., planning, reinforcement learning, and game theory practitioners) interested in exploring additional challenging environment complexities created by real-world applications of multiagent reasoning. Second, AAMAS attendees who work in applied multiagent systems developing solutions in the types of applications that involve OASYS and are seeking decision making solutions for such problems. In this way, we hope to provide useful background information for both audiences, as well as bring together researchers across the decision making and application spaces of AAMAS for cross-pollination of ideas and development of new collaborations.</p>
